# Machine Learning Task One:
## Category: Regression
## Sub-Category: Linear Regression
## ML Model: Predictive Models

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model built from scratch using Python. The goal is to predict the office price based on office size using gradient descent optimization.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - numpy 
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

**Run code**
1. Place `NairobiOfficePriceEx.csv` in the same directory as `predictive_ml.py`
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python predictive_ml.py 
3. The output includes:
   - MSE for each epoch
   - Plot showing data points and the line of best fit
   - Predicted price for an office of size of 100 sq. ft.
